I"ô<p>This release makes including third party plugins easier.
Until now, the push state approach to loading new pages has been interfering with embedded <code class="highlighter-rouge">script</code> tags.
This version changes this by simulating the sequential loading of script tags on a fresh page load.</p>

<p>This approach should work in a majority of cases, but can still cause problems with scripts that canâ€™t be added more than once per page.
If an issue canâ€™t be resolved, thereâ€™s now the option to disable push state by setting <code class="highlighter-rouge">disable_push_state: true</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-happening">Whatâ€™s happening?</h2>
<p>The problem is as follows:
When the browser encounters a <code class="highlighter-rouge">script</code> tag while parsing a HTML page it will stop (possibly to make a request to fetch
an external script) and then execute the code before continuing parsing the page
(itâ€™s easy to how this can make your page really slow, but thatâ€™s a different topic).</p>

<p>In any case, due of this behavior you can do things like include jQuery,
then run code that depends on jQuery in the next script tag:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">".../jquery.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">#tabs</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">someJQueryFunction</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// works</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™d consider this an anti-pattern for the reason mentioned above,
but it remains common and has the advantage of being easy to understand.</p>

<p>However, things break when Hydejack dynamically inserts new content into the page.
It works fine for standard markdown content like <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code> tags,
but when inserting <code class="highlighter-rouge">script</code> tags the browser will execute them immediately and in parallel,
because in most cases this is what youâ€™d want.
However, this means that <code class="highlighter-rouge">$('#tabs').someJQueryFunction();</code> will run while the HTTP request for jQuery is still
in progress â€” and we get an error that <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> isnâ€™t defined, or similar.</p>

<p>From this description the solution should be obvious: Insert the <code class="highlighter-rouge">script</code> tags one-by-one,
to simulate how they would get executed if it was a fresh page request.
In fact this is how Hydejack is now handling things (and thanks to rxjsâ€™ <code class="highlighter-rouge">concatMap</code> it was easy to implement),
but unfortunately this is not a magic solution that can fix all problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some scripts may throw when running on the same page twice</li>
  <li>Some scripts rely on the documentâ€™s <code class="highlighter-rouge">load</code> event, which has fired long before the script was inserted</li>
  <li>unkown-unkowns</li>
</ul>

<p>But what will â€œmagicallyâ€ solve all third party script problems, is disabling dynamic page loading altogether,
for which thereâ€™s now an option.
To make this a slightly less bitter pill to swallow,
thereâ€™s now a CSS-only â€œintroâ€ animation that looks similar to the dynamic one.
Maybe you wonâ€™t even notice the difference.</p>
