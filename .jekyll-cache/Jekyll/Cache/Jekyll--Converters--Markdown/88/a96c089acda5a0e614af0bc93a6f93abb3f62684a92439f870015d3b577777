I"¡<p>Hydejack has always featured a JavaScript-heavy sidebar, but other than that, JS has been used sparingly.
This changes with this release, which adds a ton of (optional) code that changes the feel of the theme dramatically.</p>

<h2 id="major">Major</h2>
<p>Pages are now loaded and swapped through JavaScript. This has a number of effects.
First of all, it looks cool, but the animations aren‚Äôt just about aesthetics:
They also help to hide the network time of fetching the next page, making the entire site feel faster.
At the same time, the <abbr title="Flash of Unstyled Content">FOUC</abbr> introduced in the last release will no longer occur (except on the initial page load).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most JS is now unified in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_js</code> directory and written in ES2016.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog-by-tag</code> layout has been renamed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">list</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">public</code> folder has been renamed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">assets</code> to make the theme compatible with Jekyll‚Äôs gem-based themes.</li>
  <li>Tags are now supported via Jekyll Collections instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">_data</code>.</li>
  <li>The sidebar can now add links to all kinds of pages.</li>
  <li>Categories are now supported.</li>
  <li>Author information moved to <code class="highlighter-rouge">_data/authors.yml</code></li>
  <li>Added support for multiple authors.</li>
  <li>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll-feed</code> plugin (supported on GitHub Pages) instead of custom solution.</li>
  <li>Added <code class="highlighter-rouge">about</code> layout.</li>
  <li>Added <code class="highlighter-rouge">not-found</code> layout.</li>
  <li>Added <code class="highlighter-rouge">redirect</code> layout</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="minor">Minor</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The ‚Äúaccent‚Äù font (heading font) is now used for all headings.
This gives the theme a ‚Äúbolder‚Äù look and was necessary for the animation: link =&gt; heading.</li>
  <li>Changed default text font from ‚ÄúPT Serif‚Äù to ‚ÄúNoto Serif‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Added <a href="/docs/7.5.2/writing/">CSS classes</a> for styling markdown content.</li>
  <li>Links have a new style.
They now always display an underline to make the choice of the link color less critical (darker colors were hard to
distinguish from regular text).</li>
  <li>Made social media icons larger and easier to tap.</li>
  <li>Social media icons are now also part of the ‚Äúabout‚Äù sections of a post.</li>
  <li>Added support for a copyright notice at the bottom. Can be set via the config variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">copyright</code>.</li>
  <li>Changed responsive breakpoints and added support for very large displays.</li>
  <li>The site is now printable.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog</code> layout now only shows the excerpt instead of the full post.</li>
  <li>Links to external pages are now marked with a symbol.</li>
  <li>Added margin above social media icons to prevent accidental tapping</li>
  <li>Added gem files so that <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code> work</li>
  <li>Disabled HTML minification when running via <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code></li>
  <li>Added dingbat to signal end of post</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Related posts is no longer blank for posts that do not belong to a category.</li>
  <li>Footnotes now use the text version of ‚Äúleftwards arrow with hook‚Äù instead of the emoji on iOS.</li>
  <li>Text is no longer invisible while waiting for Google Fonts to load.</li>
  <li>Always show scrollbar to prevent layout ‚Äújumps‚Äù</li>
</ul>
