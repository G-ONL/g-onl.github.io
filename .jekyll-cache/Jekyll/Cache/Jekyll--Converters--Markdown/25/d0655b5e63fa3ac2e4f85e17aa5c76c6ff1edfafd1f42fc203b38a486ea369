I"<p>While v7 brings an <a href="/CHANGELOG/#v700">insane amount of new stuff</a>, the most notable change is the new background image.
It is no longer <em>anti-selling</em> the theme.
The old image was a blurred version of Napoleon Bonaparte, which was just… weird. I could tell the story of how this came to be,
but I’d rather show you the new and improved background image.</p>

<h2 id="new-background-image">New background image</h2>
<p>Yes, it’s an aerial shot of a beach (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ios+11+background&amp;t=ffab&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">so hot right now</a>).</p>

<p>Q: What has this picture to do with Hydejack?
Nothing really, I just like how it looks.
However: Boat → Pirates → Hijacking → Hydejack (illuminati confirmed)</p>

<p>Even though it is a free image from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> (…), it’s unique in the sense that
I’ve modified it so it looks better inside the sidebar.
Specifically, I’ve straightened out the beach and rotated the boat so that it sits at a nice 90 degree angle.</p>

<p>For comparison, here is the non-euclidean mess the <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/AtvuPUenaeI">original photo</a> was. Pretty OCD, I know.</p>

<h2 id="new-color-palette">New color palette</h2>
<p>I’ve extracted the major colors from the background image, which now form Hydejack’s color palette:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/COLOURlovers.com-Hydejack.png" alt="Hydejacks's color palette" style="border: 1px solid #ddd" /></p>

<h2 id="new-logo">New logo</h2>
<p>Hydejack also has a new logo, which is based on the new color palette.
It also features the best font on Google Fonts, and probably the world: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab">Roboto Slab</a>
(which is to say, I like it a lot).</p>
