I"<p>While v7 brings an <a href="/CHANGELOG/#v700">insane amount of new stuff</a>, the most notable change is the new background image.
It is no longer <em>anti-selling</em> the theme.
The old image was a blurred version of Napoleon Bonaparte, which was just… weird. I could tell the story of how this came to be,
but I’d rather show you the new and improved background image.</p>
